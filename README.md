Not done yet. Webpack is spitting out some errors and I still plan to add features on the front end and a few tricks. <br>
Security issue in Axios was flagged today. <br>

There are inconsistencies in formatting (single vs double quotes and semicolons). Been fiddling with Linter, hopefully not a breaking issue.
